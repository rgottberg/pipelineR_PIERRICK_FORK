Welcome to the **pipelineR** package! 🚀

**pipelineR** is a lightweight internal R package designed to automate the fetching, cleaning, and inserting of stock market data into a PostgreSQL database.


---

## Features

- Connect securely to a PostgreSQL database
- Fetch historical OHLCV stock data from Yahoo Finance
- Automatically clean and reshape the data
- Insert only new (non-duplicate) rows into the database
- Log processing batches into a pipeline_logs table
- Fully tested with `testthat`

---

## Installation

```r
# You can install directly from the internal Git repository:
remotes::install_github("pkinif/pipelineR")

```

---

## Usage

Connect to the database:

```r
library(pipelineR)
con <- connect_db()
```

Make sure your `.Renviron` contains:

    PG_DB='yourdbname'
    PG_HOST='yourhost'
    PG_USER='youruser'
    PG_PASSWORD='yourpassword'
    PG_SCHEMA='yourschema'
    user_login='yourname'
    
Run the full pipeline:

```r
pipelineR::start_pipeline(
  from = Sys.Date() - 10,
  to = Sys.Date(),
  batch_size = 20
)
```
